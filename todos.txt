1. add more different modules with new functions!

	[Essentially, just collections of functions put via 'convert'...]; 

2. [Later] when working further on JS-code parsing - create a version that WOULDN'T have to double the stack usage whenever using this style; 

	Currently, 2 stack frames are wasted on a function. 
	[This is a result of doing it this way]

3. Add more DOM stuff to the library.
